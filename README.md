### ðŸš€ `assistant` Visual Studio Code Extension

Your personal (re-) writing assistant for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) based
on [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3).

## Getting started

2. Add the API Key to VSCode Settings (`assistant.gpt3.apiKey`)
3. Trigger your first completion using `ctrl+cmd+j`
4. Trigger your first edit using `ctrl+cmd+g`

Hint: You do not have to use the keyboard shortcuts, in the VSCode command palette (`ctrl+shift+p`) simply search for `gpt3` to identify the relevant commands.
